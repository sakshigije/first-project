        <p>Thiba palace was built by British Government to keep the former king of Brahmadesh (Now Myanmar) Thabba Min in house arrest. 
            It was built in the year 1910. Until 1916, the king and queen of Myanmar lived in this palace.
             Now there is a museum in this palace. 
            Some of the things used by King Thibaw are still preserved in this palace.
            The palace is a beautifully constructed three storied structure with sloping roofs.
             Semi-circular wooden windows with beautiful carvings are the main attraction of this structure. 
             There is a dancing hall with marble floor on the first floor. One Buddha idol is installed at the back side of the palace. 
             This idol was brought to India by king Thiba.
